# Task System
A manual-first system for organizing general tasks.

This is something I set up for myself and is designed to be used for life. It must always be fully usable manually because technologies change over time. Flexible folder trees for organizations with simple human readable text metadata files in task folders is a good base. The task folders can store arbitrary data as needed.

It is also designed to be parseable though manual changes must always be reflected by the parser. Parsers are replaceable and ideally use technology that is usable for a long time.

The task system is found in the "tasks" folder. It is prepared to be copied as-is in your desired installation location.

# Documentation
Documentation follows the task system wherever it is installed. It is found in the "tasks/docs" directory.
